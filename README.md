# Guides

Resources for learners who want to dive deeper on their journey to becoming web developers. 
There are four guides, the first which outlines the bare minimum to be successful as an 
entry-level junior web developer, two that dive much more deeply to prepare you for "beyond junior", 
and one that focuses on game development.

## Get Job ready with 13 projects, 2 courses, and 10 books 

A structured plan of resources and activities for learners who want to beeline to "job ready" and get there 
reasonably prepared to be successful.

**Goal:** confident web developer ready to apply for junior positions

## Computer Science and Web Development - comprehensive

Get prepared, over the long haul, to be an established senior level software engineer, capable of 
architecting solutions for the web (and beyond it) 

_"not in a rush" plan, with resources to increase the depth of knowledge gained in general computer science topics plus
sufficient implementation practice to confidently enter the industry as a Web Developer or a Software Engineer in 
non Web related positions_

**Goal:** proficient web developer and software engineer 
(this option has more of a computer science focus, but also web development)

## Attribution

* Many of the courses listed closely mimic the list from [Open Source Society University - Computer Science](https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science)
* Many of the topics selected to augment were inspired by [Google Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/google-interview-university)
* Many of the projects were inspired by (or are directly taken from) [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/) and [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/)

Although I took heavy inspiration from many resources when creating these guides, none of it is a cut and paste path from somewhere else. Often, I substituted courses (especially in the case of Coursera) to ensure that the entire course was available for free and required no purchases of any kind. Where possible, I tried to align projects to reinforce prior learning.
